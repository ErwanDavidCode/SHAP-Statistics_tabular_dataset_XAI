# ðŸ§  XAI on Tabular Models â€” Interpretability

This project explores explainability techniques on tabular data using linear regression, random forests and GAM. We apply XAI methods â€” including t-values interpretation, feature importance for random forests and SHAP as a post hoc method â€” to better understand model predictions and decision logic.

Due to data confidentiality constraints, the datasets used in this study are not publicly available in this repository.
